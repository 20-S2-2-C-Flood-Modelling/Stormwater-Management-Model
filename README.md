# Introduction
This is the open source SWMM source code repository maintained by the Open
Water Analytics group.

SWMM is a dynamic hydrology-hydraulic water quality simulation model. It is
used for single event or long-term (continuous) simulation of runoff quantity
and quality from primarily urban areas. SWMM source code is written in the C
Programming Language and released in the Public Domain.
